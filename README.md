This is an enhanced viewer for the GOES-14 1-minute "SRSOR" imagery being put out on an experimental basis by the UW Space Science and Engineering Center.

**Original SSEC viewer:**  http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/data/1min/index.php?

## Goals

The eventual goal of this project is to create a flexible viewer where you can select a time range you're intersted in and save a zoomed-in area temporarily (the region that the satellite is focused at tends to change from day-to-day).

Right now only the full 1km resolution visible wavelength imagery is available.

## Setup

All you should need to do is run `npm install` to get the server and all the front-end dependencies installed (via Bower).
